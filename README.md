This is meant to download a user's tiktok collection. To use this, the user just needs to have a .txt file of each tiktok link separated on its own line. The best way to do this is to use the tiktok-to-ytdlp extension in FireFox.
I created this to download and store the tiktoks my girlfriend and I have saved in our collections to my media server--for viewing once tiktok was taken down... which has been pushed back multiple times now, so this project is mostly useful for data hoarding and gym sessions.

## Prerequisites
- .txt file of newline-delimited tiktok URL's--the URL's you would like to download
- Folder you would like to save the collection into

## Steps to Run (the application terminal also details how to run through each step)
##### Open File
- Select this button to bring up the file navigation view
- Select the .txt file with newline-delimited tiktok URL's
- It will load the URL's into memory and print the list into the terminal for visibility

##### Select Folder to Save Videos Into
- Select this button to bring up the file naviation view
- Navigate to the folder of your choosing where you would like the tiktoks to be saved inside

##### Run
- Run
- Click to run
- The terminal window will display the current progress as tiktoks are downloaded
