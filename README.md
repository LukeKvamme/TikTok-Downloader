This is meant to download a user's tiktok collection. To use this, the user just needs to have a .txt file of each tiktok link separated on its own line.

  - GUI
  - Selecting place on disk to download
  - Selecting the .txt file containing each link
  - Picture collections -- They are more tricky to deal with, will work on this last probably.
